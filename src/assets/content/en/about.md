### The idea

The idea appeared 3 years ago at the middle school of Alpes Mancelles located in Moulins le Carbonnel. During a discussion with friends, we imagined a retro game console that could be accessible to everyone, with a low price for the retro-videogame culture to return to the front of the stage. So we started with the idea of ​​creating a console, based on an Arduino (picture in support). We realized that the performances were not sufficient compared to our expectations. Subsequently we had a second idea, this time based on a microcomputer named Raspberry-Pi Zero (picture in support) that offered us more possibilities and flexibility for our project. From there, we started to develop an ideal console and then began to concretely design this console. We took part in several brainstorming sessions and gathered ideas that could or could not be found in the search for the most suitable console for our audience.
